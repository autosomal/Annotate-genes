# BED File Gene Annotation and Enrichment Analysis Solution

## Overview
This project provides a complete solution for BED file gene annotation and enrichment analysis. It includes tools for annotating genomic regions with gene information and performing functional enrichment analysis.

## Project Structure
- `code/` - Contains all Python scripts for annotation and analysis
- `data/` - Sample and output data files
- `LICENSE` - Project licensing information

## Features
- BED file gene annotation functionality
- Gene enrichment analysis
- Multiple annotation methods (simple, local, complete)
- Demo and execution scripts for easy usage

## Code Components
- `bed_gene_annotation.py` - Core gene annotation functionality
- `complete_solution.py` - Complete annotation and analysis workflow
- `demo_gene_annotation.py` - Demo annotation implementation
- `execute_analysis.py` - Execution and analysis functions
- `local_gene_annotation.py` - Local annotation methods
- `run_demo.py` - Demo execution script
- `simple_gene_annotation.py` - Basic annotation implementation

## Data Files
- Sample BED files for testing
- GTF annotation file (gencode.annotation.gtf.gz)
- Output files from annotation and analysis processes

## Usage
For detailed usage instructions, please refer to `usage_guide.md`.

## Analysis Results
Example results and output files are available in the `data/` directory and described in `demo_results.md` and `complete_solution_guide.md`.
